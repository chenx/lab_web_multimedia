About
========

For video, it used to need plug-in, like adobe flash, or silverlight. Now HTML5 has navigator.getUserMedia feature implemented into some browsers, but seems like there is still a way to go to manipulate data freely as in flash.

For audio, it seems browser still does not support audio capture directly. Plug-in like flash is needed.
