This is having a hard time to work.

What I want is to continuously process audio input into mp3 and send to server, 
which then broadcast it to clients to listen to.

The problem is that:
- once started a recording session, it returns entire recording, not in incremental manner.
- for this reason you have to create a new recording session by creating new MP3Recorder object.
- therefore the user must click to start and stop to record a section.
- each time hit start, browser will prompt for allow permission.
- the prompt comes from this line:
  navigator.getUserMedia({audio: true}, handleRecord, handleRecordError);

- otherwise, if initialize it and then repeat handleRecord, it takes a stream param
  that's not accessible if not being called in getUserMedia.
- In summary, it's chaotic.

- other problems:
  - speed is slow, hard to be real-time.
