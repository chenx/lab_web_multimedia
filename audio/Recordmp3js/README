- js/mp3Worker.js:21:0 output:

- data size
  ~ 100KB/sec in blob
  ~ 4KB/sec in MP3, this is very good for transmission, no problem at all.

- restart issue?

Seems like in firefox only first time hit record it does record.
Stop and restart record, there is no effect.

In chrome this is not a problem.

Maybe it does not clear recorder properly in firefox.
Well, after hitting stop I still can hear sound in mic.
But after the audio tag appears, the mic becomes silent.

  -> well, it seems this is not a restart issue.
     even don't do anything, after a short time (10-20sec) the page no longer
     shares the mic. So it's a browser support problem.
     e.g.
     1) https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/984179
     getUserMedia audio stream dies after about 5 seconds.
     It says: After noticing not all web audio apps suffer from this problem, 
     I started digging around, and found this behavior to be related to scoping (!).

     2) https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=965483
     it's like barbage collection kicks in and collected the audio.

  -> fix: according to 1) and 2) above, local var is garbage collected, so 
     need to use global va here. So In function startUserMedia(),
     change "var input = " to "input =". Now input is a global var.
     the problem is gone. Firefox can continue recording.

- issue of do not share mic in firefox.
  
  In chrome, when choose not to share mic, it'll report "No live audio input"
  through getUserMedia's error function. 
  But in firefox, it goes silent, does not report anything.

  Other people got this problem too. See:

Decide to use setTimeout, which is more nice and considerate.

== possibility ==

Could add code in record() function in recorderWorker.js,
so it exportWAV() after length > threshold.
This simplifies code in index.html.
Question is performance.
